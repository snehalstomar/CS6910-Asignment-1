## Mapping between questions and their solutions:

1. Question1 -> cs6910_assignment_1_q1.py 
2. Question2 -> q2feedfwdNNsubmission.py
3. Question3 ->
+ q3_staged_for_submission/myDLkit.py : Our self-defined header containing implementations of the neural net, fwdProp and Backprop.
+ q3_staged_for_submission/sgd.py : solution to Q3.i. 
+ q3_staged_for_submission/SNAG.py : solution to q3.iii. --->

We have taken a fresh approach to the problem from commit Id: f257828871687812a03aadf8f6233d3e6177259a onwards. 
All new programs are stored in the directory 'assignment-1-v-2/'.
